# Human-Bot-Bidders
In this upcoming notebook, the focus will be on tracking down automated bidders on an online auction platform. Users are growing increasingly frustrated as they struggle to compete with computer-controlled counterparts, leading to a significant decline in the customer engagement. To restore customer satisfaction, the platform must eliminate computer-generated bids from their auctions.
The main objective is to pinpoint bids in online auctions placed by 'robots,' enabling the site owners to identify and remove these users, thereby preventing unfair auction practices.
